                <h5>Location</h5>
                    <li>China is located in East Asia and is the world's most populous country..</li>
                        <br>
                <h5>History</h5>        
                    <li>China's history is one of the oldest and most complex in the world, spanning thousands of years 
                        and marked by remarkable achievements and significant challenges. The earliest known Chinese 
                        civilization, the Xia Dynasty, emerged around 2100 BCE, followed by the Shang and Zhou dynasties, 
                        which established the foundations of Chinese culture, philosophy, and governance. The philosophical teachings 
                        of Confucianism and Daoism emerged during the Zhou period, influencing Chinese society deeply. In the 3rd 
                        century BCE, the Qin Dynasty unified China and laid the groundwork for the imperial system that would dominate
                        for centuries. The subsequent Han Dynasty expanded the empire and opened the Silk Road, facilitating trade and 
                        cultural exchange with the West. Over the centuries, China experienced periods of prosperity and innovation, 
                        particularly during the Tang and Song dynasties, known for advancements in technology, art, and literature. 
                        However, the country also faced invasions, internal strife, and dynastic changes, leading to periods of fragmentation. 
                        The Qing Dynasty, the last imperial dynasty, fell in the early 20th century, leading to the establishment of the 
                        Republic of China. The rise of the Communist Party in 1949 marked a new chapter in Chinese history, transforming 
                        the nation into the People's Republic of China, which has since become a major global power while navigating the 
                        complexities of modernization and its historical legacy.</li>
                         <br>
                <h5>Tourist Attraction</h5>
                    <li>China's number one tourist attraction is the Great Wall of China, a UNESCO World Heritage site that stretches over 
                        13,000 miles across northern China. Originally built to protect Chinese states and empires from invasions, the wall 
                        showcases incredible ancient engineering and construction techniques. Visitors can explore various sections of the 
                        wall, such as Badaling and Mutianyu, which are well-preserved and easily accessible. The Great Wall offers stunning 
                        panoramic views of the surrounding landscapes, including mountains, forests, and valleys. Its historical significance, 
                        architectural grandeur, and breathtaking scenery make it a must-visit destination for travelers from around the 
                        globe, attracting millions of tourists each year. </li>

                <h5>Fun Fact</h5>
                        A fun fact about China is that it is home to the largest number of bicycles in the world. 
                        With more than half a billion bicycles in use, cycling is a popular mode of transportation in 
                        many Chinese cities, especially in urban areas where traffic congestion can be an issue. </li>

                        <p style="color:black; font-size:20px;">China’s cultural food history spans thousands of years
                            and is deeply influenced by its diverse geography, philosophy, and dynastic traditions. 
                            Chinese cuisine emphasizes balance, harmony, and the concept of yin and yang in ingredients 
                            and flavours. Staples like rice, wheat, and soybeans are central, while regional diversity 
                            leads to distinct cooking styles, such as Cantonese, Sichuan, and Shandong. The ancient Silk
                            Road introduced new spices and ingredients, enriching the cuisine. Chinese food practices, 
                            such as stir-frying, steaming, and the use of soy sauce, tea, and noodles, reflect both 
                            indigenous techniques and cultural exchanges, making Chinese cuisine one of the most 
                            influential in the world.</p>

                            An ancient Chinese delicacy eaten during the Mid-Autumn Festival or Moon Festival, known as 
                            mooncake, is a pie-like pastry made with a shortcrust base called yueh ping that is 
                            traditionally filled with black sesame seed or lotus seed paste, along with red beans, 
                            roasted lamb, mung beans, dates, and salted duck egg yolks.

                            Nowadays, mooncakes are available in a variety of different sweet and savoury fillings, 
                            some of which are fruits like honeydew, litchi or pineapple; chocolate or mixed nuts; 
                            abalone and seaweed; green tea, and even cream cheese or ice cream. Their round shape is 
                            not only reminiscent of the moon, but also a symbol of return or a full circle, which in 
                            Chinese philosophy stands for fulfilment, oneness, perfection, and unity.

                            Mooncakes are meant to be shared among people, so they are typically enjoyed sliced into 
                            small wedges and usually served with Chinese tea. In ancient times, these pastries were 
                            prepared as an offering to the Moon, but over centuries they have become the most popular 
                            food of the Mid-Autumn Festival.
